                “RPS Bet,” ("us", "we", or "our") operates https://rpsbet.com (the "Site"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information we receive from users of the Site.

                We use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the Site. By using the Site, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not want RPS Bet to collect, store, use, or share your information in the ways described in this Privacy Policy, you may not play RPS Bet games or use RPB Bet’s other Services.

                For purposes of data protection laws, RPS Bet is the “data controller” of your personal information.
                </p>

                <h3>Information Collection And Use</h3>
                <p>
                While using our Site, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to your name ("Personal Information").
                </p>

                <h3>Payment Information</h3>
                <p>
                We’ll collect information related to any bets you make.

                For all bets on rpsbet.com, our third-party payment processor will collect the billing and financial information it needs to process your charges. This may include your postal address, e-mail address, and financial information. RPS Bet’s payment processors do not share your financial information, like credit card numbers, with RPS Bet, but they may share non-financial information with us related to your purchases, like your billing address, and the amount paid.

                For outgoing payments (‘Winnings’), we may collect your account-specific payment details in order to process payments to you.
                </p>

We will also store the communications you have with our Customer Service team and any additional information in those communications in order to provide support and improve the Services.

                your user identification number (like your Facebook ID number), which may be linked to
                the e-mail address you provided to that third-party application;

                If you are unclear about what information a third-party application is sharing with us, please go to the third-party application to find out more about their privacy practices.
                </p>
