                <h3>2.0 Your Dealings With Other Players</h3>
                <p>You are responsible for your interactions with other players. If you have a problem with another player, we are not required to get involved, but we can if we desire.<br>
                If you have a dispute with another player, you release RPS Bet, the RPS Bet Corporate Family, and all RPS Bet Affiliates from responsibility, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, whether known or unknown, resulting from that dispute or connected to that dispute. This includes damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data. This does not apply to users located in the EEA. If you are located in the EEA, your liability vis-à-vis RPS Bet is as set forth by the law applicable in the country where you reside.</p>

                <h3>3.0 Payment Terms</h3>
                <p>We provide a service in the form of holding payments between peers within a game of ‘Rock’ - ‘Paper’ - ‘Scissors’. In the Services you may use “real world” money to obtain a limited license and right to use Virtual Bets and/or other goods or services.</p>
                <h4>3.1 How it Works</h4>
                <p>
                You get a limited license and right to use Virtual Bets after visiting the payment gateway in one of our games or Services and providing billing authorization through the gateway on which relates to the game you are playing.<br>
                When you make a purchase on RPS Bet, the payment gateway will let you know what payment methods you can use to pay when you make your purchase. The price of the product will be the price indicated on the order page when you place your order. When your purchase is complete, we may send you a confirmation email that will have details of the items you have ordered. Please check that the details in the confirmation message are correct as soon as possible and keep a copy of it for your records. RPS Bet may keep records of RPS Bet transactions in order to handle any future questions about that transaction.<br>
                You can contact our Online Support team (<u>online@rpsbet.com</u>) for questions concerning refunds of purchases.<br>
                For Virtual Bets, your order will represent an offer to us to obtain a limited license and right to use the relevant Service(s) or Virtual Bet(s) that will be accepted by us when we accept payment. At that point, the limited license begins.<br>
                For orders to obtain a limited license and right to use Virtual Bets, by clicking the purchase/order button on the purchase window or page you:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>agree that we will supply the Virtual Bets to you as soon as we have accepted your order; and</li>
                <li>if you reside in the European Union (the “EU”), you acknowledge that you will therefore no longer have the right to cancel under the EU’s Consumer Rights Directive (as implemented by the law of the country where you are located) once we start to supply the Virtual Item.</li><br>
</ul>
                <p>You understand that while you may “earn,” “buy,” or “purchase” Virtual Bets in our Services, you do not legally “own” the Virtual Bets and the amounts of any Virtual Bet do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Any “virtual currency” balance shown in your Account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your limited license. ALL SALES ARE FINAL:<br>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT RPS Bet IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL BETS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY, OR WHETHER YOU MADE A PAYMENT THROUGH RPS BET WHERE WE OFFER OUR SERVICES.<br>
                PURCHASES TO ACQUIRE A LIMITED LICENSE AND RIGHT TO USE VIRTUAL BETS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.</p>
                
                <h4>3.2 Additional Payment Terms</h4>
<p>
                You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an Account registered to you. RPS Bet may revise the pricing for the goods and services it licenses to you through the Services at any time.</p>
                
                <h4>3.3 Billing Support</h4>
<p>
                For billing support, please contact us through <u>online@rpsbet.com</u> in which you will receive a response within 2 working days. Please note that e-mail support for billing-related issues and questions is available in English only.

                <h3>5.0 Copyright Notices/Complaints</h3>
                <p>We respect the intellectual property rights of others and ask that you do, as well. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), the E-Commerce Directive and associated legislation in the EU, and similar or equivalent other local laws that may apply.
